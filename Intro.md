# Welcome to Code Louisville's Microsoft Azure Essentials Course
  
My name is Derek Williams. I have spent the last several years being fully engulfed in the Microsoft Azure world. I absolutely love using Microsoft Azure, and other cloud technologies for that matter, but Azure is definitely my favorite. Moreover I have a passion for sharing my knowledge with others, and gaining new knowledge I may not yet possess! Let's teach each other something!    

Throughout this course you will learn key concepts needed to efficiently manage and use Microsoft Azure. Some of the core concepts we will discuss over this twelve week course are as follows:  
  
* What is Azure?  

* Overview of Azure Services

* Managing your Resources and Cost Centers

* Creating your first website in Azure  

* Storing Data in Azure  

* All About Messaging  

* Virtual Machines (Bleck!)  

* Containers, like VM's, but better!  

* and More!
