# Welcome to Code Louisville's Microsoft Azure Essentials Course
  
My name is Derek Williams. I have spent the last several years being fully engulfed in the Microsoft Azure world. I absolutely love using Microsoft Azure, and other cloud technologies for that matter, but Azure is definitely my favorite. Moreover I have a passion for sharing my knowledge with others, and gaining new knowledge I may not yet possess! Let's teach each other something!    

Throughout this course you will learn key concepts needed to efficiently manage and use Microsoft Azure. Some of the core concepts we will discuss over this twelve week course are as follows:  
  
* What is Azure?  

* Overview of Azure Services

* Managing your Resources and Cost Centers

* Creating your first website in Azure  

* Storing Data in Azure  

* All About Messaging  

* Virtual Machines (Bleck!)  

* Containers, like VM's, but better!  

* and More!

While you can get through this course having no exposure to the cloud, it helps to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

* Virtualization  

* What a website is  

* What a database is  

* Basic Powershell is encouraged, but not required.

Tools you will definitely need for this course are:

* Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code (both are free I recommend VSCode)

* Azure Powershell Cmdlets

* Azure Subscription (You can get a free one)

* Firefox, Chrome, Edge. NOT Internet Explorer
